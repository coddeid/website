                <h1>BALINESE CULTURE THAT WE SHOULD REPRESERVE</h1>
                <p><b>Balinese Dances & Traditional Performances</b> are a dynamic form of art with a strong connection
                    to religion. It plays an important role in the Balinese life and is a way of connecting with the
                    gods, either as a welcome for visiting gods or even as a communication channel in certain trance
                    dances. Every performance will start with an offering, and dancers will pray on the day of
                    performance to receive Taksu, which has no clear translation in the English language but can only be
                    closely described as Divine Inspiration. </p>

            <h1>KECAK FIRE DANCE</h1>
            <p>One of the most spectacular dances in Bali is the Kecak dance that is performed by a large group of men and boys dressed in sarongs. The performance consists of sitting in a circle while shaking their bodies and wildly moving their uplifted arms to the sound of their voices chanting Chak Chak-Chak-Chak.

                In the middle of the ring formation, the love story of the Hindu epic Ramayana is re-enacted as a dance. It shows prince Rama’s battle with the evil king in an attempt to rescue the kidnapped princess Shinta. By his side to fight the king’s army is the monkey general Hanuman.
                
                Initially, the Kecak started as a part of the Sang Hyang trance dance, which was a male-only group praying to the souls of their ancestors. But more recently, female dancers in Ubud have started performing the Kecak dance as well.
                
                The Kecak dance is best performed at night when a burning flame in the centre of the circle creates an even more dramatic effect on the mystical performance. The best Kecak show in Bali is the one held in Uluwatu Temple; a magical show with a scenic background of sunset by the ocean.</p>

            <h1>BARONG AND KERIS DANCE</h1>
            <p>This dance depicts the struggle between good and evil. The Barong represents all that is good and
                plays the role of the protector. He is the leader of all good spirits and can appear in all kind of
                shapes but dances in his most holy form, which is the Barong Keket: a combination of a big shaggy
                dog and a lion. The Barong Keket is a playful spirit who loves a bit of mischief, but when
                confronted with the evil witch Rangda, would quickly become the powerful protector. Two dancers
                support the appearance of the big Barong Keket, while only one perform the role of the evil witch
                Rangda with big fangs and claw-like fingernails.

                Supported by the energetic sounds of the gamelan, the Barong and Keris dance is an exciting dance to
                watch. The performance ends when a temple priest break the dancers from their trance with prayers
                and blessed water. Be aware that a small bird might be sacrificed in real time as part of the
                performance in order to appease any lingering evil spirits.

                The Barong could also be seen going from door to door during Galungan and Kuningan, cleansing the
                area from evil influences.</p>

            <h1>LEGONG</h1>
            <p>Legong dance is considered Bali’s most graceful dance, combining detailed finger movements, complicated steps and expressive eye movements. The classical dance is only performed by young female dancers often as young as 8 or 9 years old.

                The Legong dancers are dressed identically in very tight brocade, and gold coloured accessories from head to toe. It is amazing to see how they still can move with such speed and grace.
                
                The dance tells the story of Rangkesari gets lost in a forest and then found by King Lasem, who is hypnotized by her beauty that he refuses to let her go. Rangkesari’s brother Daha, threats King Lasem to set her free or he will initiate a war. King Lasem refuses to release her, and both men fight in the battlefield, causing the death of King Lasem. The Legong dance describes the farewell of the king.</p>

            <h1>BALINESE GAMELAN</h1>
            <p>Gamelan refers to the orchestra arrangement that are made up of predominantly percussive instruments. The traditional ensemble music is most widely performed by the Javanese, Sundanese, and Balinese, and is considered a significant representation of Indonesian culture. As soon as you land in Bali airport, you will hear the melodious symphony of Balinese music. The more you explore the island, you will find the gamelan pretty much everywhere; as it’s played on the hotel lobby, spa, restaurants, and basically anywhere in Bali.

                From a young age, Balinese kids are encouraged to join a gamelan band in the village called sekaa gong or beleganjur. Most villages in Bali have groups who rehearse regularly, for dancing and for playing the gamelan instruments. Each group is classified based on their ages and gender. These traditional orchestra groups will be booked for ceremonies at temples, personal events such as weddings, celebrations of tooth filling, and even the blessing of new businesses or houses.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Balinese gamelan is a sort of traditional gamelan ensemble that further evolved on the Indonesian island of Bali. The gamelan can be featured as part of the Hindu devotion in Bali or as communal entertainment in Bali’s banjar communities. Because the Balinese gamelan is frequently performed accompanying religious rituals or musical performances to entertain audiences, thus acts as a platform for socializing with one another.

            <h1>NYEPI</h1>
            <p>The entire island is “closed”, including the airport as there will be no incoming or outgoing flights. The roads are off limited, as everyone is expected to stay indoors for 24 hours. Because no one should be out and about, you’re prohibited from entering any beaches, and all restaurants, grocery stores, and other types of shops will be closed for everyone. Although Nyepi is primarily a Hindu holiday, non-Hindu residents and travelers in Bali observe the day of silence as well, out of respect for their fellow citizens.

                To ensure that all the rules are obeyed, local guards known as Pecalang (Nyepi Police) are deployed all over the Island, patroling their respective areas. The only exceptions are life-threatening conditions and women in labor as hospitals will still be open.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>THE NIGHT BEFORE OGOH OGOH PARADES</b>. Balinese men (and boys) carry frightening statues up to 25 feet tall and can be very heavy. With the help of a bamboo grid, the streets are accompanied by noise and gamelan music. Tourists and visitors are welcome to watch the parades, take pictures and witness this unique spectacle. Some of these ogoh-ogoh are burnt after the parade. Although these rituals take place over the entire island, one can experience the best processions either in Kuta, Seminyak, Nusa Dua, Sanur and other famous beaches. Each village makes at least one spectacular Ogoh-Ogoh and takes pride in the entire process.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>NYEPI, THE DAY OF SILENCE</h3>
                <p>This day is strictly reserved for self-reflection anything that might interfere with that purpose is strictly prohibited. When everything is starting anew, Nyepi expects a day of absolute silence, based on the four precepts of the Catur Brata:
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Amati Geni: No fire or light, including no electricity. Prohibition of satisfying pleasurable human appetites.</p>
                    
                    <p>Amati Karya: No form of physical activity except things dedicated to spiritual cleansing and renewal.</p>
                    
                    <p>Amati Lelunganan: No movement or traveling outside the home.</p>
                    
                    <p>Amati Lelanguan: No revelry/self-entertainment or general pleasure.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>The Fourth</b> is the Yoga Brata Ritual, which starts at 6:00 am on the day of Nyepi and continues to 6:00 am the next day. The more faithful Balinese would spend this day in meditation, but otherwise would follow the tradition of staying indoors.</p>

            <h1>BALINESE KITES</h1>
            <p>The Bali Kite Festival has been held in Sanur Bali every summer between June and August since the late 1990s, attracting many people, particularly kite lovers from all over the world. Hundreds of groups from all banjars (local communities) across Bali will compete with their finest kite flyer team, “Sekaa Layangan”, in the hopes of winning the large prize as the reward. Every group will build their kites in unique ways and would take months to prepare.

There is a cultural theme contest as well, where a priest will bless the kite before taking-off and a group of 70-80 people; consisting of flyers, a gamelan band, and flag bearers will march to the venue in uniform.</p>
